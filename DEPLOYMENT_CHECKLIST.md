- **Database Name**: `timewise_hrms`
- **Auto-Backup**: Available on paid plans

### Step 5: Deploy!

1. **Click**: "Apply" to start deployment
2. **Monitor**: Build logs in real-time
3. **Wait**: Initial deployment takes 5-10 minutes

## 📊 Monitoring Deployment

### Build Process (Expected)

```bash
==> Cloning repository
==> Using Node.js version 18.17.0+
==> Running build command: npm install && npm run render:build
==> Installing dependencies...
==> Generating Prisma client...
==> Setting up database...
==> Building Next.js application...
==> Build completed successfully
==> Starting application...
==> Health check passed ✅
==> Deploy successful! 🎉
```

### Deployment URLs

After successful deployment, you'll get:

- **App URL**: `https://timewise-hrms.onrender.com`
- **Health Check**: `https://timewise-hrms.onrender.com/api/health/render`

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Test Application Access

```bash
# Visit your deployed application
curl https://timewise-hrms.onrender.com

# Should redirect to signin page
```

### 2. Verify Health Check

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://timewise-hrms.onrender.com/api/health/render

# Expected response: {"status":"healthy",...}
```

### 3. Test Database Connection

- Health check endpoint will verify database connectivity
- Check Render dashboard for database metrics

### 4. Test Admin Login

Use the seeded admin account:

- **Email**: `admin@company.com`
- **Password**: `Admin123!`

⚠️ **Change this password immediately after first login!**

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Failures

```bash
# Issue: npm install fails
# Solution: Check package.json for invalid dependencies

# Issue: Prisma generation fails
# Solution: Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly

# Issue: Build timeout
# Solution: Build should complete in 3-5 minutes on free tier
```

### Runtime Issues

```bash
# Issue: 502 Bad Gateway
# Solution: Check health endpoint and server logs

# Issue: Database connection errors
# Solution: Verify DATABASE_URL and SSL settings

# Issue: Authentication failures
# Solution: Check NEXTAUTH_SECRET and NEXTAUTH_URL
```

### Performance Issues

```bash
# Issue: Slow cold starts
# Solution: Expected on free tier (3-5 second startup)

# Issue: Memory errors
# Solution: Optimized for free tier (512MB RAM)
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

### ✅ Deployment Successful When:

- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] Application starts and passes health check
- [x] Web service shows "Live" status in dashboard
- [x] Database service shows "Available" status
- [x] Can access application URL
